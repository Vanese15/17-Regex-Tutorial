My work history started with finance.  
To be honest, never in a million years would I have thought I'd end up in the tech field.  
Although, at a young age, I was fascinated with knowing how things worked. 
I completed a program and acquired a wide range of technical skills.  I currently work with a 
level 2 support team and I've had an interest in learning C++.  I enrolled in a 
Full Stack Developer bootcamp because I ultimately want to work as a Front End Developer.
